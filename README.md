# UX

## User Story
- As a user of the application, I want to be able to input tasks that I want to get done that day. I want to be able to check off each task as I accomplish them. I want the option of deleting tasks that are no longer relevant.

## Design
- Design Choices
    - The web page is a simple application designed to be as uncluttered as possible in order to fade into the background when not in use. The application itself is narrowly built in order to encourage and allow the user to have their to-do list open as a split screen, minimising the screen estate that the application takes up. A minimalist approach has been taken to the colour scheme and design. 

- Colour Scheme
    - The colour scheme has been chosen to be easy on the eye with a dark grey background (#2b2929), a jet black body (#111111) and a strong blue (#4672fe) to provide detail and highlight certain features.

- Typography
    - Throughout the app ‘Inter’ was used with a backup of ‘sans-serif’. The only exception was the title of the app which was in 'Chakra Petch’, once again, with the backup of ‘sans-serif’. Both fonts were provided by Google fonts through a CDN.

## Testing User Stories
- As a user of the application, I want to be able to input tasks that I want to get done that day. I want to be able to check off each task as I accomplish them. I want the option of deleting tasks that are no longer relevant.
    -  A user of the application is greeted with a clear, clutter free interface that is clearly titled as a to-do list. The input at the bottom of the application is auto-focussed and has placeholder text that asks the user to “Add tasks here”. The add icon next to the input changes colour when hovered over to let the user know it is a button to be clicked. Once the task is added to the list, the user is presented with intuitive icons that provide the functionality of completing to deleting the task. The application will alert the user if they try and add a task without adding text to the input. The input is limited to a max of 30 character in order to preserve the formatting of the application.
